    "## The order of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The order might matter to the solver, the above model is an example. When the `cp` solver parses a constraint, it tries to reduce their domains. The implicit (redundant) constranint using `scalar_product` can reduce the model a lot, which is much better to do before parsing `global_cardinality`. (Note: e.g. MiniZinc doesn't preserve the order of constraints during compilation, the behaviour is a bit unpredictable.)\n",
