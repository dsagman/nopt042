    "1. Write a program that solves the (directed) graph 3-coloring problem with a given number of colors and a given graph. The graph is given by a list of edges, each edge is a 2-element array. We assume that vertices of the graph are $1,\\dots,n$ where $n$ is the maximum number appearing in the list. \n",
    "2. Generalize your program to graph $k$-coloring where $k$ is a positive integer given on the input.\n",
    "3. Modify your program to accept the incidence matrix (a 2D array) instead of the list of edges.\n",
    "4. Add the flag `-n` to output the minimum number of colors (the chromatic number) of a given graph.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "picat graph-coloring.pi \"[{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,1}]\"\n",
    "picat graph-coloring.pi \"[{1,2},{2,3},{3,1}]\" 4\n",
    "picat graph-coloring.pi \"{{0,1,1},{1,0,1},{1,1,0}}\" 4\n",
    "picat graph-coloring.pi -n \"[{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,1}]\"\n",

    "In the _boardomino_ puzzle, the goal is to cover an $n\\times n$ chess board with some fields missing by domino tiles, if it is possible. The input is given by a positive integer $n$ (the size of the board) and a list of pairs (2-element arrays) of missing fileds. The first line of the output should be `yes` or `no`. If a covering exists, some reasonble representation of it should be output as well.\n",
