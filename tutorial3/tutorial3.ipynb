    "1. Write a program that solves the (directed) graph 3-coloring problem with a given number of colors and a given graph. The graph is given by a list of edges, each edge is a 2-element array. We assume that vertices of the graph are $1,\\dots,n$ where $n$ is the maximum number appearing in the list. \n",
